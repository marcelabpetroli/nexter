This is a mock-up webpage for a luxury real estate company focused on exclusive properties and clientele. The webpage establishes credibility by highlighting media features in outlets like BBC and Forbes and showcasing the company's Top 3 realtors. Users can browse cards displaying available homes with key details, and a photo gallery offers a glimpse into the luxurious interiors to inspire potential buyers. The design aims for both visual appeal and functionality to provide a high-end user experience.

I had a great time coding this webpage together with the instructor, and the challenges along the course were super important for my growth as a developer. I learned so many tricks and new techniques that completely changed the way I see layouts. I have a whole new appreciation for grids and all the power that comes with using this technology.
